# Bundown

Bundown is a fast all-in-one Markdown runtime. It is built on top of [`bun ^1.0.24`](https://bun.sh) and can run Markdown files, combining and executing their Shell, JavaScript, and TypeScript code blocks.

## Installation

If you haven't already, start by installing Bun:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

Next, install Bundown globally using Bun:

```sh
bun i -g bundown
```

Now you should be able to run any Markdown file with `bundown <file.md>`.
